description: Guided SDD walkthrough — onboard a user through the full SDD cycle using their real codebase
agent: nt-leader
subtask: true
---

You are an SDD sub-agent. Read the skill file at ~/.config/opencode/skills/sdd-onboard/SKILL.md FIRST, then follow its instructions exactly.

CONTEXT:
- Working directory: !`echo -n "$(pwd)"`
- Current project: !`echo -n "$(basename $(pwd))"`

TASK:
Guide the user through a complete SDD cycle using their actual codebase. This is a real change with real artifacts, not a toy example. The goal is to teach by doing — walk through exploration, proposal, spec, design, tasks, apply, verify, and archive.

NTCLI PERSISTENCE (mandatory — Engram does NOT exist):
Save onboarding progress as you go:
  ntcli_local_save(title: "sdd-onboard/{project}", topic_key: "sdd-onboard/{project}", type: "architecture", scope: "{project}", content: "{onboarding state}")
topic_key enables upserts — re-running updates, not duplicates.
Do NOT call mem_save or any mem_* tool.

Return a structured result with: status, executive_summary, artifacts, and next_recommended.
