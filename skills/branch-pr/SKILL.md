## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a pull request for any change
- Preparing a branch for submission
- Helping a contributor open a PR

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Every PR MUST link an approved issue** — no exceptions
2. **Every PR MUST have exactly one `type:*` label**
3. **Automated checks must pass** before merge is possible
4. **Blank PRs without issue linkage will be blocked** by GitHub Actions
5. **Hard-gates are fail-fast**: if any preflight gate fails, DO NOT create or update the PR

---

## Preflight Hard Gates (Blocking)

Run these gates in order. On first failure: stop immediately and return a blocking error.

### Standard Blocking Error Format

```text
PR_BLOCKED: <gate> | fix: <action>
```

### Gate 1 — Template Contract (mandatory)

- The PR body MUST be built from repo template `pull_request_template.md` **exactly**.
- If the template file is missing, sections are removed, or required sections are left incomplete/empty, block PR creation/update.

Fail examples:
- `PR_BLOCKED: template_missing | fix: create repo file pull_request_template.md and re-run preflight`
- `PR_BLOCKED: template_incomplete | fix: complete all required sections from pull_request_template.md without deleting headings`

### Gate 2 — Language Contract (mandatory)

- For this user, PR body text MUST be es-AR (rioplatense, voseo natural).
- If body is in another language or neutralized style, block.

Fail example:
- `PR_BLOCKED: language_mismatch | fix: rewrite PR body in es-AR rioplatense using the template sections`

### Gate 3 — Branch Scope + Naming Contract (mandatory)

- Source branch MUST match naming policy regex and active change scope.
- Reusing legacy/unrelated branches is forbidden.
- If branch scope does not align with the current approved issue/change, block.

Fail examples:
- `PR_BLOCKED: branch_name_invalid | fix: create a new branch using type/description naming policy`
- `PR_BLOCKED: branch_scope_mismatch | fix: create a fresh branch tied to the active change scope and cherry-pick relevant commits`

### Gate 4 — Fail-Fast Execution Rule

- If **any** gate fails: stop preflight and do NOT run `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit`.
- Only proceed to PR commands when all gates pass.

### Policy Parity Note

- These gates are policy-level and apply equally to GitHub and Azure DevOps.
- Tooling differs (`gh` vs `az repos pr`), enforcement does not.

## Workflow

```
1. Verify issue has `status:approved` label
2. Create branch: type/description (see Branch Naming below)
3. Implement changes with conventional commits
4. Run shellcheck on modified scripts
5. Open PR using the template
6. Add exactly one type:* label
7. Wait for automated checks to pass
```

---

## Branch Naming

Branch names MUST match this regex:

```
^(feat|fix|chore|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|revert)\/[a-z0-9._-]+$
```

**Format:** `type/description` — lowercase, no spaces, only `a-z0-9._-` in description.

| Type | Branch pattern | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<description>` | `feat/user-login` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<description>` | `fix/zsh-glob-error` |
| Chore | `chore/<description>` | `chore/update-ci-actions` |
| Docs | `docs/<description>` | `docs/installation-guide` |
| Style | `style/<description>` | `style/format-scripts` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<description>` | `refactor/extract-shared-logic` |
| Performance | `perf/<description>` | `perf/reduce-startup-time` |
| Test | `test/<description>` | `test/add-setup-coverage` |
| Build | `build/<description>` | `build/update-shellcheck` |
| CI | `ci/<description>` | `ci/add-branch-validation` |
| Revert | `revert/<description>` | `revert/broken-setup-change` |

---

## PR Body Format

The PR body MUST come from repository template `pull_request_template.md` exactly (same sections, complete content). Every PR body MUST contain:

### 1. Linked Issue (REQUIRED)

```markdown
Closes #<issue-number>
```

Valid keywords: `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Resolves #N` (case insensitive).
The linked issue MUST have the `status:approved` label.

### 2. PR Type (REQUIRED)

Check exactly ONE in the template and add the matching label:

| Checkbox | Label to add |
|----------|-------------|
| Bug fix | `type:bug` |
| New feature | `type:feature` |
| Documentation only | `type:docs` |
| Code refactoring | `type:refactor` |
| Maintenance/tooling | `type:chore` |
| Breaking change | `type:breaking-change` |

### 3. Summary

1-3 bullet points of what the PR does.

### 4. Changes Table

```markdown
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file` | What changed |
```

### 5. Test Plan

```markdown
- [x] Scripts run without errors: `shellcheck scripts/*.sh`
- [x] Manually tested the affected functionality
- [x] Skills load correctly in target agent
```

### 6. Contributor Checklist

All boxes must be checked:
- Linked an approved issue
- Added exactly one `type:*` label
- Ran shellcheck on modified scripts
- Skills tested in at least one agent
- Docs updated if behavior changed
- Conventional commit format
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailers

---

## Automated Checks (all must pass)

| Check | Job name | What it verifies |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| PR Validation | `Check Issue Reference` | Body contains `Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N` |
| PR Validation | `Check Issue Has status:approved` | Linked issue has `status:approved` |
| PR Validation | `Check PR Has type:* Label` | PR has exactly one `type:*` label |
| CI | `Shellcheck` | Shell scripts pass `shellcheck` |

---

## Conventional Commits

Commit messages MUST match this regex:

```
^(build|chore|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|revert|style|test)(\([a-z0-9\._-]+\))?!?: .+
```

**Format:** `type(scope): description` or `type: description`

- `type` — required, one of: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`
- `(scope)` — optional, lowercase with `a-z0-9._-`
- `!` — optional, indicates breaking change
- `description` — required, starts after `: `

Type-to-label mapping:

| Commit type | PR label |
|-------------|----------|
| `feat` | `type:feature` |
| `fix` | `type:bug` |
| `docs` | `type:docs` |
| `refactor` | `type:refactor` |
| `chore` | `type:chore` |
| `style` | `type:chore` |
| `perf` | `type:feature` |
| `test` | `type:chore` |
| `build` | `type:chore` |
| `ci` | `type:chore` |
| `revert` | `type:bug` |
| `feat!` / `fix!` | `type:breaking-change` |

Examples:
```
feat(scripts): add Codex support to setup.sh
fix(skills): correct topic key format in sdd-apply
docs(readme): update multi-model configuration guide
refactor(skills): extract shared persistence logic
chore(ci): add shellcheck to PR validation workflow
perf(scripts): reduce setup.sh execution time
style(skills): fix markdown formatting
test(scripts): add setup.sh integration tests
ci(workflows): add branch name validation
revert: undo broken setup change
feat!: redesign skill loading system
```
